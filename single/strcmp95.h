/* The strcmp95 function returns a double precision value from 0.0 (total
   disagreement) to 1.0 (character-by-character agreement).  The returned 
   value is a measure of the similarity of the two strings.                   */

/* Date of Release:  Jan. 26, 1994					      */
/* Modified: April 24, 1994  Corrected the processing of the single length
             character strings.
   Authors:  This function was written using the logic from code written by
             Bill Winkler, George McLaughlin and Matt Jaro with modifications
             by Maureen Lynch. 
   Comment:  This is the official string comparator to be used for matching 
             during the 1995 Test Census.                                     */
